# Virtual Reality Wood Harvester Simulator #

This work was conducted at Oregon State University using Federal funds under award #07-79-07914 from the Economic Development Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. The statements, findings, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Economic Development Administration or the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Our Virtual Reality Wood Harvester Project involves creating a VR experience comparable to a real harvester where the user can get effective training in operating a harvester within a safe environment and with less cost. This involves creating a realistic 3D forest environment that exactly resembles a real landscape with real tree locations. This also involves creating a functional Harvester in VR that has controls that mimic the real harvester. Meaning the user can operate the harvester in order to gain experience in delimbing and cutting down trees.

### How do I get set up? ###

NOTE: Our project partner and stakeholders mentioned above do not want the exact workflow/code to recreate this project to be disclosed. Hence we will not be submitting a video.

Current compatible versions for template: Latest Engine Version (Template is not kept to as many compatible versions as the plugin itself).

* Right click on VRExpPluginExample.uproject and switch to your preferred (compatible) engine version.
* If project files did not automatically generate after switching, right click again and select "Generate Visual Studio Files"
* Open Solution and build - Or download the pre-built binary package from the forum thread for the engine version and place into the plugins directory.
* Run

You need to have visual studio installed and follow the UE4 setup guide for it: https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/

If you want to set up a different terrain, follow this guide https://docs.google.com/document/d/133Vf6EgnMjNxLHRqBu-Up9t6NF8EQpd5yfdEtEVZ8XQ/edit?usp=sharing

This project is desgined to be built to standalone Oculus Quest 2. Here is the guide to build to Oculus Quest 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nixc8NF_97s
